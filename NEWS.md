The Alerts of Alerts application computes leading indicator alerts over three different statewide summary time series. These summary time series include: 
  1. Statewide CC & DD Category percent (statewide Emergency Department visits for selected CC & DD Category/total statewide ED visits), 
  2. The number of alerting counties/regions in the state (computed using the EWMA/Adaptive Regression algorithm), and 
  3. the number of counties whose incidence of the selected CC & DD Category is estimated to be increasing (using smoothing splines).

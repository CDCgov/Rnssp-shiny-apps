#' Find clusters
#'
#' Function will return clusters, given a frame of case counts by location and
#' date, a distance matrix, a spline lookup table, and other parameters
#' @param cases a frame of case counts by location and date
#' @param distance_matrix a square distance matrix, named on both dimensions
#' @param detect_date a date that indicates the end of the test window in which
#'   we are looking for clusters
#' @param spline_lookup default NULL; either a spline lookup table, which is a
#'   data frame that has at least two columns: including "observed" and
#'   "spl_thresh", OR a string indicating to use one of the built in lookup
#'   tables: i.e. one of \code{"001", "005", "01", "05"}. If NULL, the default
#'   table will be 01 (i.e. \code{spline_01} dataset)
#' @param baseline_length integer (default = 90) number of days in the baseline
#'   interval
#' @param max_test_window_days integer (default = 7) number of days for the test
#'   window
#' @param guard_band integer (default = 0) buffer days between baseline and test
#'   interval
#' @param distance_limit numeric (default=15) maximum distance to consider
#'   cluster size. Note that the units of the value default (miles) should be
#'   the same unit as the values in the distance matrix
#' @param baseline_adjustment one of four string options: "add_one" (default),
#'   "add_one_gloabl", "add_test", or "none".  All methods except for "none"
#'   will ensure that the log(obs/expected) is always defined (i.e. avoids
#'   expected =0). For the default, this will add 1 to the expected for any
#'   individual calculation if expected would otherwise be zero.
#'   "add_one_global", will add one to all baseline location case counts. For
#'   "add_test_interval", each location in the baseline is increased by the
#'   number of cases in that location during the test interval. If "none", no
#'   adjustment is made.
#' @param adj_constant numeric (default=1.0); this is the constant to be added
#'   if \code{baseline_adjustment == 'add_one'} or \code{baseline_adjustment ==
#'   'add_one'}
#' @param min_clust_cases (default = 0); minimum number of cluster cases to
#'   retain before compression
#' @param max_clust_cases (default = Inf); maximum number of cluster cases to
#'   retain before compression
#' @param post_cluster_min_count (default=0); a second (or alternative) way to
#'   limit cluster. This parameter can be set to a non-negative integer to
#'   require that any final clusters (post compression from candidate rows) have
#'   at least \code{post_cluster_min_count} cases, when aggregated over all
#'   locations within the identified cluster
#' @param use_fast boolean (default = FALSE) - set to TRUE to use the fast
#'   verson of the compress clusters function
#' @param return_interim boolean (default = FALSE) - set to TRUE to return all
#'   interim objects of the find_clusters() function
#' @export
#' @returns returns a list of two of two dataframes.

# Spline-Based Cluster Detection Shiny App

### Description

An R Shiny app for visualizing the spline-based cluster classification/detection approach.

## Credentials

While the app will work with a local file upload option, Rnssp credentials are required to use the API version. Options include:

1.  Saving an rds file with credentials locally, and loading that file when asked
2.  Entering credentials via username and password when asked (i.e. within app when api request is made)
3.  Reading an rds file within a project-level `.Rprofile` file, to bypass the request for credentials each time the app is launched. To do this:

``` r
saveRDS(Rnssp::create_profile(), file="rnssp_creds.rds")
```

and then create the `.Rprofile` file within the root of this repo

``` r
myProfile <- readRDS("rnssp_creds.rds")
```

### Requirements

Requires the following libraries
```R
library(shiny)
library(cli)
library(geosphere)
library(data.table)
library(bslib)
library(bsicons)
library(DT)
library(ggplot2)
library(leaflet)
library(leaflet.extras)
library(tigris)
library(sf)
library(shinyjs)
library(shinycssloaders)
library(Rnssp)
library(plotly)
library(kableExtra)
```
Note: a common error regarding `tabset` construction will be raised if `bslib` package version is not updated to at least 0.9.0 (or higher)

### Launch the app:
The easiest way to launch the app is to run:
```
shiny::runGitHub("lmullany/spline_cluster_detector_app")
```
Note that the above required packages must be first installed (and updated to latest versions) in order to run this app
